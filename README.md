# Zoom Android TV Launcher

This Android TV application improves the usability of the Zoom app. As the Zoom app is not optimized for Android TV's, there is no practical option to open or close Zoom. Additionally, the application can use the [Zoomy](https://github.com/robinp7720/TelegramZoomReminderBot) API to load upcoming lectures. 

## How does it work? 

The application can start or stop Zoom. As there is no elegant solution, stopping Zoom is performed through opening a non-existent Zoom meeting. This is working fine though. 

After providing the URL of the Zoomy `/all` endpoint in the text field, the application will also load all upcoming lectures and show them in a list view. Clicking them will open them in Zoom straightaway. 

## It does not work for you?

## How to participate?
